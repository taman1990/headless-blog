This project is a **dark, developer-focused blog frontend** built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS v4**, designed for readability, performance, and long-term maintainability.  
The visual style is inspired by **VS Code’s dark theme**, keeping distractions low and content front and center. 🌑⚡

Posts are written in **Markdown**, statically generated, and exposed through **clean SEO-friendly URLs**.  
The blog includes **automatic post listing on the homepage**, **tag pages**, a **tags sitemap**, and a fully working **RSS feed** for readers who prefer subscriptions.

Typography and layout are intentionally minimal, optimized for **night reading** and long-form content.  
With SEO, sitemap, RSS, and a reusable GitHub template setup, this project is meant to be **used, extended, and shipped**, not just looked at. 🎮📄🚀
