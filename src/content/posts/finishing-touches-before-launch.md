At some point, adding features stops being the hard part — knowing when to stop becomes the challenge.  
Pagination, tags, and active navigation are small details, but together they decide whether a blog feels finished or just functional.

In this project, these features were added deliberately and late in the process.  
That timing matters, because structure should serve real content, not hypothetical scale.

A clean launch isn’t about having every feature imaginable.  
It’s about shipping something complete, understandable, and easy to extend when the next real need appears.
